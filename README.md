ChrF++ is an automatic evaluation metric for machine translation (and other text generation tasks). It's an improvement of the original ChrF metric, and it's known for being:

    *) Language-independent
    *) Based on character n-gram F-scores
    *) Better at handling morphologically rich languages

    Why “ChrF++”?

    The original ChrF was based on character-level precision and recall.
    ChrF++ extends this by combining word-level and character-level n-grams, which gives better correlation with human judgments.
